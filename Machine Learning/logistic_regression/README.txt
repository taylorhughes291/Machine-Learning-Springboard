Hi!

If you have downloaded the entire repository from GitHub, then you should more or less be ready to go with this script and assignment. Wherever you decide to download the repository, the only folder you need for it is the folder labeled “logistic regression”. Once you have that saved where yo want it, open up the file “logistic_regression.Rproj” and load the script titled “logistic_regression.R”.

Before you run the script, make sure you have the following packages installed in R (feel free to copy and paste the following into your command line prior to running the script):

install.packages(“effects”)
install.packages(“caTools”)
install.packages(“ROCR”)

Once you have these installed, feel free to run the script and it should work perfectly!

Once run, you will be able to see a tutorial for logistic regression, as well as an exercise I have performed trying to guess if folks have ever worked based on their age and their marital status. Pretty interesting stuff!
