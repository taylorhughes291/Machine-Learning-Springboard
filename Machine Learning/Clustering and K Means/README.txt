Hello, and welcome to my folder/repository on Clustering and K Means. Please open the file  titled “1505932415_clustering.R” and run the script. You will see that you should have the appropriate packages installed, as outlined in the script. Once that is complete, you will then run the script and see a demonstration on clustering wine into 3 different types.

Thank you!
